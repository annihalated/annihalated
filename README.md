### Hi, I'm Nihal

Iâ€™m a lawyer, researcher, and writer.

My areas of competence do not have an identifiable common theme yet â€“ this is something Iâ€™m still figuring out. Iâ€™m interested in a lot of things: doctrinal research, data science, constitutional law, finance, literature, and software. I will update this when I have a pithier and more focused sense of my research interests.

I grew up in Chennai and Kozhikode, and now live in Delhi.

Iâ€™m currently at Vidhi, where I use a combination of legal research and policy analysis to strengthen the framework for End of Life Care, understand healthcare provider accountability better, and improve pharmaceutical regulation. Opinions expressed on this site are my own.
